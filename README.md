# Tracking-and-Evasion-using-Co-Training-with-Context-Knowledge

## Abstract

In the evolving technological landscape, autonomous systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) have gained importance. Among these, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exemplify the synergy of AI and robotics, finding applications in diverse domains, from surveillance to disaster response. This thesis addresses a specific challenge: optimizing UAV trajectories for precise target tracking within urban environments. It employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a game-theoretic co-training approach, simultaneously training an evading target and a tracking UAV. This approach promotes diverse target strategiessand mitigates the risk of observer policy overfitting. While previous research has focused on empty environments, this thesis introduces urban environments into the RL framework, enhancing realism and practicality. Urban environments, containing buildings and roads, offer a more authentic and realistic context compared to empty environments. To ensure effective learning and diversity, a procedural map generation technique is employed to generate maps, resembling typical urban layouts. The procedural map generation introduces a novel dimension to this research and complements the utilization of context knowledge, referring to the knowledge introduced by the representation of the urban environments with maps. This context knowledge, extracted from the maps using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are integrated into RL models, enriches agent observations regarding urban environments. The thesis evaluates the performance of the agents under various scenarios with different maps and observation spaces. The results are assessed by analyzing the utilization of context knowledge, both alone and in combination with state observations. These assessments include evaluations of target evasion and observer tracking performance, as well as the presentation of exemplary agent trajectories.
